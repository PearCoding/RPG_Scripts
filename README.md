# RPG_Scripts

This repository contains a lot of different scripts and tools for the RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker MV (soon).
Not all of them are useful together and some of them are not even well tested.
But all of the code is (still) from active game development.

Enjoy and get inspired as I got inspired by browsing the forums :)
